                        <h2>Introduction</h2>
                        &emsp;Covid-19 has developed into a global pandemic since the beginning of 2020. From the moment that
                        the first case was found in the U.S. on January 20, the U.S. passed 200,000 deaths on September
                        22 (Chappell). On September 29, 7 days after the record-breaking number of deaths, both
                        candidates participated in the discussion about the virus in the first presidential debate. <br/>

                        &emsp;Biden argued that “the president has no plan” to deal with the growing number of cases in the
                        U.S., while Trump argued back that he is “doing a phenomenal job” against the virus. <br /><br />

                        &emsp;What we
                        care about here is people’s reaction towards both candidates’ speech and to evaluate Twitter as
                        a platform of recording the historical events for future use.

                        <h2>Rationale for Searching Tweets</h2>
                        &emsp;To investigate people’s reaction towards the discussion regarding Covid-19 in the first
                        presidential debate, we used <strong style="color: #1da1f2">#debate2020</strong> and <strong style="color: #1da1f2">#election2020</strong> as hashtags. To filter out the tweets
                        that are more relevant to Covid among millions of tweets that contain these hashtags, we used
                        the advanced search function in Twitter. In the “Any of these words” session of the advanced
                        search, we put “#debate2020 #election2020 Covid”, which provides us the tweets that contain any
                        combination of these three keywords: it could be any one of them, any two of them or all of
                        them. To obtain more influential results, we added a restriction that the tweets had to have
                        more than 1,000 likes. Finally, since the first presidential debate was on September 29 and we
                        observed a trend that real-time reactions usually grabbed more attention, we focused on the
                        tweets that were posted from September 29, 2020 to October 3, 2020.

                        <h2>Different Perspectives</h2>
                        <h4>As Seen via Tweets</h4>
                        &emsp;The search result provides two perspectives as it contains tweets that support both candidates.
                        Even though the number of tweets supporting each side is not balanced, it is unknown whether the
                        bias is created by real data or users’ activities. Comments under these tweets, however, are
                        more balanced. It is common to see arguments under a tweet, no matter which side the original
                        tweet supports.

The comments under this tweet, however, are more multifaceted: some challenging the statistics, some blaming Trump, some doubting whether the data’s relation to white supremacy, etc. <br /><br/>

                        <br />
                        &emsp;This tweet argues that Covid is not the real issue for the United States but the shutdown is. It believes that shutdowns are what cause people to depress and be more addicted to alcohol and drugs. Based on the account owner’s political position and beliefs, it is reasonable to think that there would be many supporting comments, but it appears to be the opposite. Most liked comments insist that Covid is the real problem, but others also have concerns about the shutdowns: some worrying about economics, while others worrying about the children’s education, etc. <br /><br/>

                        <h2>Limitations of Twitter</h2>
                        &emsp;With the acknowledgement of the need for a more massive dataset and a more professional
                        analyzing tool than human analysts, we noticed that Twitter users receive biased feeds based on
                        their political opinions. If you are a supporter for one of the candidates or parties, it is
                        harder to reach tweets that are in favor of the other. This results in consolidating people’s
                        thoughts even more and it would be harder for anyone who wants to stay neutral or objective. It
                        creates a world that you have to pick a side and put your root in it. However, this is an impact
                        and it is not necessary to categorize it as a benefit or a limitation: it is beneficial for
                        people as it is more convenient for them to obtain the information that they need, while it is
                        harmful as it may block people’s sight at the same time.
                        <br />
                        &emsp;However, we did notice a limitation of Twitter’s search engine when we used it to gather
                        information: there were not just two perspectives regarding this topic and the search results
                        blocked almost all the perspectives other than democrats (Biden) and republicans (Trump). Both
                        the presidential debate and the Covid-19 issue are global topics. Not only Americans were paying
                        attention to them and discussing them. The hashtags #debate2020 and #election2020 were the most
                        popular ones, but they rarely included any other tweets except those that were posted by
                        Americans. It is true that there is a filter for languages in the search engine, but the amount
                        of data is significantly low for studying. Except for the reason that fewer people outside the
                        US reacted to these topics, there is also another possibility that people who are native in
                        other languages do not use an English hashtag. Even though they may have a discussion in another
                        hashtag that is worth to be included in the study, it is almost impossible for the mass public
                        to know and understand their opinions.

                        &emsp;The way we search the tweets and try to understand the presidential debate as a historical event
                        via social media (i.e. Twitter) does show how valuable the social media is as an ethical use and
                        preservation of data (Galarza 792). Although it is a large database sufficient for research use,
                        finding an efficient way to filter out information remains an issue. A lot of Twitter users’
                        tweets are too short or empty to provide any useful information. The brevity of tweets
                        “encourages the kind of cryptic, condensed language associated with text messaging in general.”
                        (Arceneanux 1268) The misunderstanding created by the brevity leads to unnecessary
                        arguments/data. Therefore, finding useful data among people’s chatting tweets in such a huge
                        database is definitely challenging and obscured.
