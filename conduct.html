                        <h2>Introduction</h2>
                            &emsp;There has not been a debate more distinct and involving more personal behavior and bantering between candidates in a time when the clash of social issues are so heightened in the modern digital age before this year’s 2020 Presidential Election. Joe Biden and Donald Trump have taken “mud-slinging” to a whole new level, and consequently social media such as Twitter eats content like this up. 
                            &emsp;Twitter has been the most prominent digital media platform for independent individuals to debate freely and express their ideas and opinions. The hashtags are important to be able to track the mass opinions on specific subjects where it becomes more than a presidential debate between two presidential candidates but a breeding ground for debate and expression of personal ideals for Americans. That shows the real characteristic and has a more accurate representation of a monumental event like this, providing better real insight on a micro level. The specificity of the words in the hashtags pinpoint memorable topics during the debate. With the tweets available, we are able to reconstruct the debate piece by piece today and 10 years from now. The hashtags we used for our topic were <strong style="color: #1da1f2">#debate2020</strong> and <strong style="color: #1da1f2">#election2020</strong> and the date range we entered was the length of the debates which were 09/29/2020 - 10/03/2020.

                        aria-labelledby="v-pills-profile-tab">
                        <h2>Rationale for Searching Tweets</h2>
                        &emsp;This is an important event because not only does it represent the clash of ideas and show where this country’s going but it also excites a lot of reaction and insight and expression from internet users. The combination of the two hashtags are very important that they are together so it makes sure we get relevant tweets regarding the presidential election of this year and not any presidential election but also only election content on the presidential debate of this year so we can flush out extraneous tweets that involve other aspects of the presidential election race (Ex: campaigning not presented at the debates). It serves as a cross-checking mechanism. 
                        &emsp;And the date range had to run only during the length debates so we get the tweets of people during the debate in real time and not speculation tweets of the debate before the debate happened or reflection of the debate after the debate happened because realize that people have their most raw perceptions and are inclined to act with less restraint when things happen in the moment. For example, once the winner of the election is revealed after the debate, it  greatly affects how people tweet about the debate after it has happened which presents flawed reflection in which we are not interested in. We want to evaluate their true selves.

                        <h2>Different Perspectives</h2>
                        <h4>As Seen via Tweets</h4>
                        &emsp;The selected hashtags are used by people posting on Twitter during the selected date range very vaguely and not very specifically. People use the selected hashtags when talking about anything during the debate, but because the nature of a debate is to disagree with the opponent along with the fact that we knew about the excessive and explicit bantering, we speculated that the debate itself would be composed of back and forth insults, changes of behavior, and many actions and complementary reactions. Therefore, we only needed these two hashtags and were able to find a lot of content on the behavioral aspect of the debate.

                        <h2>Limitations of Twitter</h2>
                        &emsp;Unless if you have large following, the value of your tweet is not evaluated accordingly because of your small following, which undervalues effective and insightful tweets and gives a disproportionate advantage of exposure for those who have already had a large following even if they do not provide a much good insight or know very little of political knowledge (Ex. celebrity vs an actual politician with not as much notoriety). Due to the fact the debate was more for entertainment value, a lot of non-political, inexperienced individuals tuned in (celebrities) and diluted the tweets of political insight with their reactions. <br/><br/>
                        <h5>Limitations of Advanced Search</h5>
                        &emsp;Even with Advanced Search options, we realized that there is no way to filter out specific time of tweets so we couldn't search for tweets during the time of the specific event so we had to scroll to find tweets about the debate during the debate and go through any extraneous tweets.<br/>

                        &emsp;Additionally, there is no definition of what an effective amount of likes or retweets is considered. There is no way of quantifying and defining trending tweets. We wondered <i>What makes a trending tweet a trending tweet?</i> Therefore, we were forced to make an arbitrary decision and selected tweets with at least 1000 likes and 1000 retweets. <br/>

                        &emsp;Lastly, we were forced to not use too many hashtags because if we did, then Twitter focused the scope in too much, providing only Tweets that included all of the hashtags. Therefore, we also used keywords and used the “Includes Any of these words” function by searching up specific and big topics that Biden and Trump insulted each other on like “son” to pinpoint a broad selection of tweets reflecting on Trump insulting Biden's family. Finding that perfect balance between a broad, inclusive search and an exclusive selection of relevant tweets was quite difficult with just hashtags, but keywords and the inclusiveness of the “Any” aspect of the keyword search function made it a lot easier to search for tweets regarding the event based on specific topics to get the insight that we really wanted (refer to Figure 3).<br/><br />

                        <h2>Key Concepts from Class Readings</h2>
                        &emsp;The way we search the tweets and try to understand the presidential debate as a historical event
                        via social media (i.e. Twitter) does show how valuable the social media is as an ethical use and
                        preservation of data (Galarza 792). Although it is a large database sufficient for research use,
                        finding an efficient way to filter out information remains an issue. A lot of Twitter users’
                        tweets are too short or empty to provide any useful information. The brevity of tweets
                        “encourages the kind of cryptic, condensed language associated with text messaging in general.”
                        (Arceneanux 1268) The misunderstanding created by the brevity leads to unnecessary
                        arguments/data. Therefore, finding useful data among people’s chatting tweets in such a huge
                        database is definitely challenging and obscured.
